	public void capturingArgumentsForFurtherAssertions() {
		// Mockito verifies argument values in natural java style: by using an
		// equals() method. This is also the recommended way of matching
		// arguments because it makes tests clean & simple. In some situations
		// though, it is helpful to assert on certain arguments after the actual
		// verification. For example:

		someMock.someMethod("John");
		
		ArgumentCaptor<String> argument = ArgumentCaptor.forClass(String.class);
		verify(someMock).someMethod(argument.capture());
		assertEquals("John", argument.getValue());
			 

		// Warning: it is recommended to use ArgumentCaptor with verification
		// but not with stubbing. Using ArgumentCaptor with stubbing may
		// decrease test readability because captor is created outside of assert
		// (aka verify or 'then') block. Also it may reduce defect localization
		// because if stubbed method was not called then no argument is
		// captured.

		// In a way ArgumentCaptor is related to custom argument matchers (see
		// javadoc for ArgumentMatcher class). Both techniques can be used for
		// making sure certain arguments where passed to mocks. However,
		// ArgumentCaptor may be a better fit if:
		// - custom argument matcher is not likely to be reused
		// - you just need it to assert on argument values to complete verification

		// Custom argument matchers via ArgumentMatcher are usually better for stubbing.

	@Test
	public void restMocks() {
		// Smart Mockito users hardly use this feature because they know it

		// Instead of reset() please consider writing simple, small and focused
		// test methods over lengthy, over-specified tests. First potential code
		// smell is reset() in the middle of the test method. This probably
		// means you're testing too much. Follow the whisper of your test
		// methods: "Please keep us small & focused on single behavior". There
		// are several threads about it on mockito mailing list.

		// The only reason we added reset() method is to make it possible to
		// work with container-injected mocks. See issue 55 (here) or FAQ
		// (here).

		// Don't harm yourself. reset() in the middle of the test method is a code smell (you're probably testing too much).

	@Test
	public void spyingRealObjects() {
		// You can create spies of real objects. When you use the spy then the
		// real methods are called (unless a method was stubbed).

		// Real spies should be used carefully and occasionally, for example
		// when dealing with legacy code.

		// Spying on real objects can be associated with "partial mocking"
		// concept. Before the release 1.8, Mockito spies were not real partial
		// mocks. The reason was we thought partial mock is a code smell. At
		// some point we found legitimate use cases for partial mocks (3rd party
		// interfaces, interim refactoring of legacy code, the full article is
		// here)

		List<String> list = new LinkedList<String>();
		List<String> spy = Mockito.spy(list);

		// optionally, you can stub out some methods:
		when(spy.size()).thenReturn(100);

		// using the spy calls real methods
		spy.add("one");
		spy.add("two");

		// prints "one" - the first element of a list
		System.out.println(spy.get(0));

		// size() method was stubbed - 100 is printed
		System.out.println(""  + spy.size());

		// optionally, you can verify
		verify(spy).add("one");
		verify(spy).add("two");

		// Important gotcha on spying real objects!
		// 1. Sometimes it's impossible to use when(Object) for stubbing spies.
		// Example:

		// List list = new LinkedList();
		// List spy = spy(list);
		//
		// //Impossible: real method is called so spy.get(0) throws
		// IndexOutOfBoundsException (the list is yet empty)
		// when(spy.get(0)).thenReturn("foo");
		//
		// //You have to use doReturn() for stubbing
		// doReturn("foo").when(spy).get(0);

		// 2. Watch out for final methods. Mockito doesn't mock final methods so
		// the bottom line is: when you spy on real objects + you try to stub a
		// final method = trouble. What will happen is the real method will be
		// called *on mock* but *not on the real instance* you passed to the
		// spy() method. Typically you may get a NullPointerException because
		// mock instances don't have fields initiated.
	}
	
	@Test
	public void partialMocks() {
		// Finally, after many internal debates & discussions on the mailing
		// list, partial mock support was added to Mockito. Previously we
		// considered partial mocks as code smells. However, we found a
		// legitimate use case for partial mocks - more reading: here

		// Before release 1.8 spy() was not producing real partial mocks and it
		// was confusing for some users. Read more about spying: here or in
		// javadoc for spy(Object) method.

		// you can enable partial mock capabilities selectively on mocks:
		LinkedList<String> mock = mock(LinkedList.class);
		
		// Be sure the real implementation is 'safe'.
		// If real implementation throws exceptions or depends on specific state
		// of the object then you're in trouble.
		when(mock.size()).thenCallRealMethod();

		// As usual you are going to read the partial mock warning: Object
		// oriented programming is more less tackling complexity by dividing the
		// complexity into separate, specific, SRPy objects. How does partial
		// mock fit into this paradigm? Well, it just doesn't... Partial mock
		// usually means that the complexity has been moved to a different
		// method on the same object. In most cases, this is not the way you
		// want to design your application.

		// However, there are rare cases when partial mocks come handy: dealing with code you cannot change easily (3rd party interfaces, interim refactoring of legacy code etc.) However, I wouldn't use partial mocks for new, test-driven & well-designed code.
